I. About
----------------------------------------------------------
----------------------------------------------------------
This short file describes how to properly handle citations
and create references.

----------------------------------------------------------
----------------------------------------------------------
II. Handling References
----------------------------------------------------------
----------------------------------------------------------
References are stored in the file myReference.bib. A
manager such as JabRef can create these reference files
easily. EndNote also has the ability to export .bib files.

In these reference files, a key will need to be specified.
The command \cite{KEY} will create an in-text citation of
the reference pointed to by KEY. The command \nocite{KEY}
will not place an in-text citation, but will only create
a bibliography entry for the reference KEY. Only those
references pointed to with \cite or \nocite commands will
be included in the bibliography.

III. Placement of Reference Sections
----------------------------------------------------------
----------------------------------------------------------
Beginning Fall 2017, References may be placed at the end
of each major section in the body of your document. If
you intend to place your references at the end of each
major section, place them under a subheading called
References (or something similar). The minimum page
length of half a page of text still applies in this case.
See the Thesis and Dissertation Manual for more
information.

IV. Getting Help

----------------------------------------------------------
Should you need assistance, feel free to email me at
szroberson@exchange.tamu.edu or at ogaps-latex@tamu.edu.
I will try my best to answer your question. When sending
an email, please be sure to send your entire LaTeX package
in a .zip archive so I can identify the issue specific to
your document.

For general questions related to the Thesis Manual, the
submission and review process, and the forms required,
contact the Thesis Office at thesis@tamu.edu. 

There will be presentations during the semester on how to
use LaTeX, so be on the lookout for these. There are also
pre-submittal conferences that outline some of the
guidelines outlined in the Thesis Manual, as well as
describe the submission process and requirements.
Events will appear on ERS when they are ready.
