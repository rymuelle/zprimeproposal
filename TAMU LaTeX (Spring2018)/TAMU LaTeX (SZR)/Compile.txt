This document outlines some basic compilation instructions
for the LaTeX template.

From a GUI, you'll need the following compilation sequence:

XeLaTeX - BibTex - XeLaTeX - XeLaTeX

PDFLaTeX is not suggested, as this template was built to
use XeLaTeX. The file Instructions.pdf outlines how to
set the proper xetex drivers.

Compilation can also be done in the terminal. Navigate to
the folder in which you have saved the main file
TAMUTemplate.tex (or whatever you may have renamed it). In
a Windows/DOS-style command prompt:

xelatex tamutemplate & bibtex tamutemplate & xelatex tamutemplate & xelatex tamutemplate

Linux users will need to replace & with && in the above.
